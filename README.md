# rb4model R Package

## Summary

This project aims to build an R package that elegantly
performs data pre-processing in a fast and easy manner. With four
separate functions that will come along with the rb4model package, users
will have greater flexibility in handling many different types of
datasets in the wild or those collected by them. With the rb4model package,
users will be able to smoothly pre-process their data and have it ready
for the machine learning model of their choice.

## Functions

`missing_val`
- This function will take in a dataframe and handle any missing values by either deleting the row, filling in the value with the average, or filling in the value with the last observation (the user will specify which method to use in the function argument).
- This function will return a dataframe without missing values.

`feature_splitter`
- This function will take in a dataframe and split the data into numerical and categorical features.
- This function will return two lists, one list containing the names of the numerical features and one list containing the names of the categorical features.

`fit_and_report`
- This function will take in data, fit a model, and calculate its training and validation scores.
- This function will return the model's training and validation scores.

`ForwardSelection`
- This function will take in data, fit a model, and perform forward feature selection.
- This function will return a dataframe with only the selected features.

## R Ecosystem

`caret` is probably the most widely used package for supervised learning problems in R. Although the library provides various model fitting and preprocessing features, programmers end up with writing the same line of code over and over again. Our `rb4model` library provides a simple solution to this pain point: wrapper functions of `caret` and other primary libraries used for supervised learning to reduce lines of code and promote efficiency.
